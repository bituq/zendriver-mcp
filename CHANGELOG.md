and this project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.3] - 2026-04-19

### Added
- `describe_shadow(selector, max_depth=6)` tool dumps a custom
  element's nested shadow-DOM tree as condensed JSON (tag/id/role/
  type/text per node, ``light`` + ``shadow`` child arrays). Replaces
  the pattern where agents hand-roll recursive ``execute_js`` calls to
  find which shadow-path leads to a control.

### Fixed
- `human_click(text=...)` is now shadow-aware: the walker finds the
  tightest interactive element matching the text (descending into
  nested shadowRoots when needed) and reads its composed viewport
  rect, so the bezier mouse path lands on the real inner button or
  ``[role="radio"]`` of a ``<nes-button>``/``<nes-selectable-radio>``
  rather than on empty space next to the host. Fixes the false-
  positive "Human-clicked" where the UI didn't actually react.
- `find_inputs` now picks up custom elements whose tag suggests an
  input (``*-input``, ``*-textarea``, ``*-field``, ``*-textbox``)
  even when they are opacity-0 during hydration or live inside
  another component's shadow root. The strict ``opacity === 0``
  visibility filter was hiding ``<nes-ovpas-input>`` and similar
  components immediately after navigation.

Tool count: 97 -> 98.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-04-19

### Added
- `click_shadow(selector, max_depth=6)` tool: given a custom element's
  light-DOM selector, recurses through every nested ``shadowRoot`` and
  dispatches a composed click on the first interactive descendant it
  finds. For design systems like NS's ``nes-*`` library where the real
  ``<button>`` / ``[role="radio"]`` lives two or three shadow roots
  deep inside ``<nes-selectable-radio>``, ``<nes-radio-button-group>``
  and friends.

### Fixed
- `click(text="...")` is now shadow-DOM aware. Previously ``page.find``
  would hit the outer custom element, ``Element.click()`` fired on the
  host and the inner handler never ran; the tool reported "Clicked"
  while nothing actually happened on the page (classic false positive
  on sites like NS.nl and bunq). The new path walks light + every open
  shadow root, picks the tightest text match, climbs to a clickable
  ancestor OR dives into nested shadow roots for the real interactive
  element, and dispatches a composed ``pointer*``/``mouse*``/``click``
  sequence.
- `find_buttons` and `find_inputs` walk open shadow roots too. Custom
  elements (``<nes-button>``, ``<sds-cta>``, ``<lion-input>``) are
  emitted with a ``(custom)`` marker so the agent knows to use
  ``click_shadow`` when the host's own click handler is insufficient.
  Recognised roles expanded to match ARIA: ``button``, ``link``,
  ``checkbox``, ``radio``, ``switch``, ``menuitem``,
  ``menuitemcheckbox``, ``menuitemradio``, ``tab``, ``option``,
  ``treeitem``.
- Shadow-piercing helper JS extracted to ``src/tools/_shadow_js.py``
  so the walker / dispatcher / clickable-detector live in one place.

Tool count: 96 -> 97.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-04-19

### Added
- `server.json` + ``mcp-name`` README marker so the package can register
  on the [MCP Registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/).
- Publish workflow now chains a ``mcp-registry`` job after PyPI upload,
  using GitHub OIDC to authenticate ``mcp-publisher``.
- README / ``docs/getting-started.md`` switched to ``uvx zendriver-mcp``
  as the first-class install path (keeping the development-checkout
  recipe available).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-19

### Added - round 2 audit follow-up
- **Path sandbox** (`src/artifacts.py`): every file-writing tool now
  rejects paths outside ``$HOME`` / the system temp dir /
  ``$ZENDRIVER_MCP_ARTIFACT_ROOT``. No more `/etc/passwd` overwrites.
  Applies to `export_cookies`, `stop_trace`, `take_heap_snapshot`,
  `screenshot`, `start_screencast`, `export_screencast_mp4`,
  `run_lighthouse`.
- `export_cookies` writes with ``chmod 0o600`` so session tokens aren't
  world-readable.
- `mock_response` rejects request bodies larger than 10 MiB.
- `ToolBase.resolve_selector` + `ZENDRIVER_ID_ATTR` constant dedupe the
  numeric-id-to-CSS-selector pattern across elements / humanlike.
- `ToolBase.__init__` auto-registers `_reset_state` callbacks, so new
  stateful tools can't forget the session-cleanup hook.
- `tests/conftest.py` with an autouse `reset_browser_session` fixture +
  `fresh_session` / `stub_mcp` fixtures.

### Fixed - round 2
- `press_key(" ")` (and `Space`) now actually inserts a space. The
  metadata branch skipped `text=`, so the key event fired but no
  character ever landed in the input.
- `type_text(replace=True)` no longer double-clicks the target; the
  redundant post-clear click was toggling date-pickers / checkboxes off.
- `fill_form` catches `json.JSONDecodeError` and raises the typed
  `ZendriverMCPError` instead of leaking an untyped traceback.
- `press_key` uses the correct CDP ``code`` for digits and punctuation
  (`Digit1`, `Minus`, `Semicolon`, ...).
- Interception race: `on_paused` captures the tab reference *inside*
  `self._lock` and exits cleanly if `stop_browser` ran mid-handler;
  previously a paused request could stay stuck in Chrome indefinitely.
- Screencast straggler-frame: `stop_screencast` clears `_frame_dir`
  before the drain sleep, so a late `screencastFrame` event no longer
  raises `AssertionError` from the Listener task.
- `compat._safe_transaction_call` guards against `EventTransaction`
  instances whose `__cdp_obj__` is None.
- `get_accessibility_snapshot` now renders every top-level AX root
  instead of silently dropping all but the first (iframes / OOPIF
  embedded content).
- `get_page_info` reads `document.title` via `page.evaluate` so the
  response is always a real string, never a bound-method repr.
- `clear_user_agent` queries `Browser.getVersion` and restores the
  real UA; empty string was leaving a *more* fingerprintable client.
- Dropped stray `--chrome-flags=--headless=false` from the Lighthouse
  invocation.

### Regression tests added
- `test_artifacts_sandbox.py` - path sandbox allow/deny paths.
- `test_forms_press_key.py` - VK metadata carries `text`, single-char
  code mapping.
- `test_escape_js.py` - table-driven JS-escape coverage.
- `test_accessibility_uid_stability.py` - uid reuse across snapshots.

Tool count still 96. Test count: 42 → 75.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-19

### Fixed

**Tool timeouts prevent session-killing hangs**
- Every MCP tool now runs inside `asyncio.wait_for` with a configurable
  budget (default 60s, or the `ZENDRIVER_MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT` env var).
  Slow tools get higher ceilings: `run_lighthouse` 300s,
  `export_screencast_mp4` 300s, `take_heap_snapshot` 180s, `bypass_cloudflare`
  120s, `get_accessibility_snapshot` 30s, etc. Before this a single hung
  CDP command could freeze the stdio loop until the client disconnected,
  tearing down the whole session. New `ToolTimeoutError` surfaces the
  boundary with the tool name and budget.

**Parser hangs on enum-version skew (root cause patch)**
- Zendriver's CDP bindings hard-code enum members from the Chrome revision
  they were generated against. When Chrome ships a new value (today's
  offender: `AXPropertyName.uninteresting`) the generated `from_json`
  raises `ValueError`, which propagates into `Transaction.__call__`,
  which is driven by the Listener task, which silently swallows the error
  and leaves the caller's future unresolved. Affected tools hang until
  our timeout guard fires.
- `src/compat.py` monkey-patches `Transaction.__call__` to convert *any*
  parser exception into a future exception. Fail-fast with the real
  error instead of a timeout. Imported with side effects inside
  `src/session.py` so the patch is in place before the first CDP
  round-trip. One patch immunises every tool against this class of bug.

**`get_accessibility_snapshot` returned only the root node**
- Two bugs in one flow. First the above parser hang. Then even with the
  hang removed the render pass emitted only `RootWebArea` because real
  Chrome puts an `ignored=true, role="none"` wrapper between the root
  and the content, and the filter treated "ignored && not interactive"
  as a hard prune.
- Rewrote the render pass to treat skipped nodes as transparent: they
  return their rendered children to the parent instead of becoming
  dead-ends. Noise roles (`none`, `generic`, `presentation`,
  `InlineTextBox`, `StaticText`) are recognised explicitly.
  Interactive-role set expanded (`menuitemcheckbox`, `menuitemradio`,
  `treeitem`). Root detected via `parentId is None`, not `raw_nodes[0]`.
- AX snapshot for example.com now returns 5 nodes (RootWebArea,
  heading, 2 paragraphs, link) in ~10 ms; previously it hung 30 s and
  timed out.
- `src/tools/accessibility.py` also bypasses zendriver's AX parser
  entirely via a local `_raw_get_full_ax_tree` generator that returns
  the CDP response dict verbatim. Safer than relying on the compat
  patch alone.

### Added

**Video export**
- `export_screencast_mp4(frames_dir, output_path, fps)`: stitch screencast
  frames into an mp4 via ffmpeg. Uses libx264 + yuv420p + `+faststart`
  so the output plays in browsers and QuickTime without re-encoding.
- `check_ffmpeg_available()` surfaces whether the CLI is installed.

**Request interception / mocking**
- New `InterceptionTools` module backed by `Fetch.enable` + a persistent
  `requestPaused` handler.
- `mock_response(url_pattern, status, body, headers)` returns a rule id;
  every matching request gets the mocked response.
- `fail_requests(url_pattern, error_reason)` drops matching requests with
  a CDP `Network.ErrorReason` value (e.g. `BlockedByClient`,
  `InternetDisconnected`, `TimedOut`).
- `list_interceptions()` and `stop_interception(rule_id?)` manage rules.
- Each rule tracks a `match_count` so tests can assert "this mock fired".

**Proxy**
- `configure_proxy(proxy_url, user_data_dir, headless)` and
  `clear_proxy(...)`. Chrome can't swap proxies at runtime so we restart
  the browser; pass a `user_data_dir` to preserve the logged-in session.

**PyPI release workflow**
- `.github/workflows/publish.yml`: on `v*` tag push, builds sdist + wheel
  with `uv build` and publishes via Trusted Publishing (OIDC, no API
  tokens needed on the repo side).
- `docs/releasing.md` walks through PyPI pending-publisher setup, cutting
  a release, and the manual fallback.

**ToolResponse adoption**
- `BrowserTools.get_browser_status`, `NavigationTools.get_page_info`, and
  `TabTools.list_tabs` now return the `ToolResponse` envelope
  (`{"summary", "data"}`) so agents can programmatically inspect state
  instead of parsing strings.

**Docs**
- `docs/recipes/mock-api-responses.md` covers `mock_response`,
  `fail_requests`, and rule management.
- `docs/tool-reference.md` updated to cover proxy, interception, and the
  new screencast tools.

Tool count: 88 -> 96. Test count: 24 -> 38.

### Added - initial fork shape

**Housekeeping**
- `uv` project layout, pinned to Python 3.12.
- Ruff + mypy config, pytest scaffold with smoke tests.
- GitHub Actions CI (ruff, ruff format --check, mypy, pytest).
- `LICENSE` file (MIT) and PyPI-ready package metadata (keywords,
  classifiers, project URLs).
- `docs/` directory with getting-started, full tool reference, and three
  recipe guides (login-reuse, Cloudflare, performance audit).
- Manual integration smoke: `scripts/integration_smoke.py`.

**Stealth + human-like input**
- `StealthTools`: `bypass_cloudflare`, `is_cloudflare_challenge_present`,
  `set_user_agent`, `clear_user_agent`, `set_locale`, `set_timezone`,
  `set_geolocation`.
- `HumanInputTools`: `human_click`, `human_type`,
  `estimated_typing_duration`, built on bezier mouse paths and gaussian
  keystroke timing primitives in `src/humaninput.py`.

**DevTools parity**
- `EmulationTools`: viewport, device profiles (iPhone 15 Pro, Pixel 8,
  iPad Pro, Desktop 1080p), CPU throttle, network presets (offline /
  slow-3g / fast-3g / 4g / no-throttling), `emulate_media`.
- `DevToolsTools`: `start_trace` / `stop_trace` producing DevTools-loadable
  JSON; `take_heap_snapshot` producing `.heapsnapshot` files.
- `LighthouseTools`: `run_lighthouse` and `check_lighthouse_available`,
  shelling out to the Lighthouse CLI against the browser's remote
  debugging port.

**Session + network control**
- `CookieTools`: `export_cookies`, `import_cookies`, `list_all_cookies`,
  `clear_all_cookies` - CDP-level, covers HTTP-only cookies and all
  origins (upstream `storage.get_cookies` only reads `document.cookie`).
- `NetworkControlTools`: `block_urls`, `unblock_all_urls`,
  `set_extra_headers`, `bypass_service_worker`.
- `PermissionsTools`: `grant_permissions`, `reset_permissions`,
  `list_permission_names` with a curated short-name table.

**Quality of life**
- `ScreencastTools`: `start_screencast` / `stop_screencast` using CDP
  `Page.startScreencast` events, writing frames to disk as JPEG or PNG.
- `AccessibilityTools`: `get_accessibility_snapshot` returns the CDP AX
  tree keyed by stable uids, `click_by_uid` performs deterministic
  interaction, `describe_uid` returns cached metadata.
- `ToolResponse` envelope (`src/response.py`) for structured dict returns
  with `summary` / `data` / `files` keys.
- Richer error taxonomy: `CloudflareChallengeError`, `TracingError`,
  `LighthouseNotInstalledError`, `AccessibilityUidError`.
- Consolidated CLI in `src/server.py` with `--browser-path` and
  `--transport` flags; `run.py` kept as a compatibility shim.

### Fixed
- `type_text` referenced an undefined `self._tab`; now sends
  `cdp.input_.insert_text` through the active tab.

### Changed
- `ToolBase._register_tools` is now an `@abstractmethod`, matching actual
  usage in subclasses.
- Bumped to `0.2.0` to signal the new shape.

Tool count: upstream 49 -> 88.

## Acknowledgements

The token-optimised DOM walker and the original 49-tool foundation come from
[ShubhamChoulkar/Zendriver-MCP](https://github.com/ShubhamChoulkar/Zendriver-MCP).
This release takes that base and grows it into a full DevTools + stealth
automation suite.
